# Cpp-Programming

All my C++ programs since I started my journey.

This repository is a personal archive of small C++ projects and exercises.

# Project-specific notes

- BUFFET LIST — a small menu program (compile the main file inside).
- FIGURE INHERITANCE — object-oriented program (shapes, inheritance, polymorphism).
- MATRIX AND VECTORS — numeric examples and matrix/vector operations.
- MINI GAME WITH FIELD — small game (may require multiple source files; compile the folder or follow in-folder instructions).
